- C# Delegates and Razor Pages Practice

This repository contains exercises completed while studying C# and ASP.NET Core.

The focus was to understand delegates, events, and how they are used in real applications.
I also built a small Razor Pages project to practise basic web development with .NET.

I am currently preparing for a junior C# developer position and these exercises are part of my learning process.
